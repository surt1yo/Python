#Create a python program to create a flashcard using object-oriented programming. 
#A flashcard is a two-sided card with information on both sides that can assist memory.
# A question and an answer are usually printed on one side of a flashcard. 
#Follow these steps to complete the activity - 
#1. From the user, take the input for a word and its definition. 
#2. To assign values for Word and Meaning, create a class called flashcard 
#and use the __init__() function. 3. We'll use the __str__() function to get a 
#string with the term and its definition. 4. Save the strings that have been returned in a list. 
#5. To print all of the stored flashcards, use a while loop.
